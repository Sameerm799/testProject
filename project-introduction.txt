The goal of this project is to provide a mobile user a application that allows using more then one app at once. 
In today's day in age you see people constantly switching through apps, each having different purposes. 
Wouldn't it be easier to work on more then one app at once? The answer is yes. 
You want to watch a video but you have to text your mother at the same time. 
With the app you can have the video displayed and the texting application displayed together without having to miss a funny moment or a important message. 
Say you are in a rush to work but haven't finished your slides for your presentation and also did not memorize what you will say during the presentation. 
Have no fear with the app you can have your notes shown and you can edit your presentation at the same time.
